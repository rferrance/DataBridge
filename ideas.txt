Authenticator with cert/key and timestamp, sent to the server which checks it's current and the logs to authenticate.
All transmissions will be encrypted before they are sent and decrypted at the other end.  This will use something like the authentication, possibly a second algorithm using 
the same principals (they will be synced since it was already checked that the other two are synced and they will be pulled at about the same time)

Only one user can connect at a time second user can use chat but gets messages saying the other parts are unavailable.
